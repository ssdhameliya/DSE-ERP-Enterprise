                    • Makes the global UI enhancer traverse logical JavaFX content inside TabPane, ScrollPane, TitledPane and Accordion so hidden Reports tabs, Dashboard and Safe Rollback receive the same table/KPI contract as normal pages.
                    • Hardens DynamicTableLayoutManager with generation-based stale-layout rejection and live VirtualFlow/scrollbar observation so drawer/sidebar close restores the final table viewport instead of an intermediate width.
                    • Makes KPI density depend on real available pixels per card, preserves one-row equal distribution and removes Reports-only CSS width ownership that could collapse Scheduled Report cards.
                    • Adds the strict Phase 3 UI contract to the authoritative release gate and removes exact duplicate theme blocks while keeping exactly two runtime theme files.

                    • Repairs Item Master category registrations for CATEGORY, UNIT, MATERIAL, BRAND and GST on fresh and upgraded PostgreSQL databases.
                    • Preserves Category/HSN/Unit snapshots across Sales, Purchase and Quotation lines and exposes the missing Item metadata in transaction tables/search.

                    • Adds a read-only View JSON Data action in PDF Studio so users can verify the exact record payload being mapped without manually editing JSON.

                    • Attachment preview materialisation is now shared across Sales, Purchase, payment, quotation, refund and Purchase Recon workflows; remote preview/count reads stay off the JavaFX Application Thread.

                    • Fixed light-mode splash startup title and description contrast on the white content card.

                    Bank Statement
                    • Removed the right-side reconciliation process/status guide panel.
                    • Reclaimed that width for the search, filters and transaction table so more bank data is visible at once.

                    Startup Reliability
                    • Fixed Spring Boot startup failure caused by the transactional SMTP service being declared final.
                    • Kept SMTP settings transactional while restoring Spring AOP/CGLIB proxy compatibility.

                    Maintenance
                    • Added a regression test to prevent the transactional SMTP service from becoming non-proxyable again.

                    Permissions
                    • Rebuilt the Permission Matrix into one compact role workspace with module rows and capability columns.
                    • Added role templates, copy-from-role, search, granted-only filtering and an effective-access preview.
                    • Added tri-state row and column controls so bulk grants remain clear without a page-level scroll.
                    • Preserved module-specific capabilities through a dedicated Special menu instead of hiding uncommon permissions.
                    • Kept permission persistence server-owned so LOCAL and company-server deployments use the same role matrix.

                    Maintenance
                    • Added shared permission catalog metadata so future modules and capabilities can be surfaced without adding FXML checkboxes for every permission.
                    • Scoped Permission Matrix styling to the workspace to avoid cascading changes into unrelated screens.

                    Security
                    • Added five-attempt password lockout with clear attempt counters and automatic account locking.
                    • Added five-attempt MFA verification lockout across sign-in challenges.
                    • Added explicit lock reasons so automatic security locks remain distinct from administrator locks.
                    • Verified password reset can clear automatic security locks, while administrator locks remain protected.
                    • Administrator unlock now clears failed-attempt counters and security lock state.

                    Audit
                    • Added security audit events for failed sign-in attempts, MFA failures, automatic locks and administrator lock/unlock actions.

                    • Added real server-enforced multi-factor sign-in for accounts with MFA enabled.
                    • Aligned MFA settings between administrator-created and self-registered accounts.

                    Multi-User
                    • Strengthened shared-server Backup & Restore and simultaneous reference allocation.
                    • Added safer standalone/company-server deployment transitions.

                    Backup & Recovery
                    • Corrected database-size reporting to use the connected PostgreSQL database.
                    • Added clearer confirmations and warnings for backup and restore actions.

                    Email
                    • Unified company-server SMTP settings and simplified App Password visibility controls.

                    Excel Studio
                    • Improved merged/border property visibility and semantic color consistency.

                    Updates
                    • Added an in-app What's New view so release changes remain easy to review.
